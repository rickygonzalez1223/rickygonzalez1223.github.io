# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Ricardo Gonzalez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Electrical Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites if not my favorite lab because I'm an engineering major therefore I have a lot of math and physics classes,
    this lab I was able to apply to my field because in physics and my calculus class I get a lot of word problems involving units and I
    always have to convert them which is why I thought this lab was very interesting and fun. In this lab I learned how to plug in an equation
    into my code so that when you input a number it'll convert it into different units for you, saving you all the math in between. Additionally this
    lab we started using a functions.cc file which was a little difficult at first but once defined the function for all our units in the functions.cc
    file we were able to work with our units.cc file and get it running! This lab was just something I would definitely be able to implement into my         daily life for my major and homework!

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite labs, it was one of my favorites because similarly to my previous response it was something I can
    really apply to my major since it involves finding the area of a rectangle. This connects not only to computer science but also engineering
    which is what I am very interested in. I learned in this lab how modular programming works, modular programming is just when different elements
    of our programs are defined in different files. Not only did I learn about how to apply this into my coding but also how I can apply coding into
    engineering which is why I loved this lab.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 is also one of my favorites just because in my opinion overall this whole lab was very fun. We learned how to code a program that
    will follow a pattern to read the components of a sandwich from command-line arguments, then write out a sentence to describe an order for the
    sandwich as output. This made it very fun because you could get creative with your sandwich and design it however you'd like, you'd be able to add
    bacon, wheat bread, cheese, etc. Secondly this lab was shorter and simple which made it fun to complete and then mess around with. This lab taught
    me a lot because this program could be applied to real life situations, one example being a cash register software or ordering app. Overall this lab
    also taught me how to apply coding into real life situations and have fun with it too, which is why this is another one of my favorite labs.
